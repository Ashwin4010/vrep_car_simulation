# V-REP Car Simulation

## Introdution
The aim of this project is to simulate and control one or more cars in V-REP using ROS. This is part of the [Open Source Self-Driving Car Initiative](http://ossdc.org/join) (see in GitHub https://github.com/OSSDC/). 

The mission of this initiative and open organization is to bring the best research in self-driving car space and create a full stack of open source software and hardware components to allow anyone to build and test from toy to full-size self-driving cars.

We are investigating several solutions, like Unity3D, a PS3/PS4 simulator and V-REP, to check their advantages and drawbacks.

## V-REP and ROS
V-Rep is a General purpose 3D robot simulator with integrated development environment developed by <a href="http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/" target="_parent">Coppelia Robotics</a>. Sensors, mechanisms, robots and whole systems can be modeled and simulated in various ways.
 
There are several ROS interfaces available for V-REP: see [here](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/rosInterfaces.htm). You could use the [RosInterface](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/rosInterf.htm), but in this case, you should program in LUA to apply the command coming from ROS (you can do it directly in V-REP using the [embedded script](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/scripts.htm) that you can associate with any object in the scene). 


In this case, I used the [VREP ROS Bridge](https://github.com/lagadic/vrep_ros_bridge/tree/master), mainly because the functionalities I needed are already implemented. 

We need to:
* publish images coming from a vision sensor
* apply a twist velocity to an object with respect to its frame.

## Installation:

To test the scene, you will need to follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/lagadic/vrep_ros_bridge/tree/master). You will have then installed ROS, V-REP and the V-REP Ros Bridge. 

## Launch Scene 
Remember to run a roscore before launching V-REP.   

Now you can run V-REP and open the scene `roads_car_ros`.

You can find the model of the car [here](http://tf3dm.com/3d-model/car-white-61307.html), and the model of the roads [here](http://tf3dm.com/download-page.php?url=street-system-v10-48448).

When you play start, the plugin will:
* publish images coming generated by the vision sensor placed on the white car.
* subscribe to a twist command to move the red car


## Future work:
* Simulate the Ackermann steering mechanism. Right now the car is just a static object. There is simple model in V-REP under the folder `example`
* Add other sensors, like a lidar.
